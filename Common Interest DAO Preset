This piece of documentation aims to explain: 

1. Your DAOâ€™s purpose.
2. Whether the creation of a market is essential or not.

What is the DAO going to be used for?

- Token holders will submit proposals related to various community initiatives, create polls and initiate discussion. Members can then vote on these proposals to determine which ones receive the communityâ€™s support..

Is creating a market essential for your token?

Reasons you might want to create a market upon launch for:

1. People occupying space in your community when being inactive and canâ€™t sell the token.

Reasons you might not want to create a market upon launch for:

1. Creating a market requires resources.
2. The team might want to strengthen the community or develop their product better before launching a market.

Note: An OTC market is a better solution for your token.
