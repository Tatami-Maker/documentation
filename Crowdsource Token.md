## This piece of documentation aims to explain: 

1. Identifying the optimal community for your token.
2. Your DAO’s purpose.
3. Whether the creation of a market is essential or not.


## How should you identify the optimal community for your token?

When launching a token you want to airdrop tokens to people that will add value to your community, just by being a part of it. Hence, we introduce you to the All-Stars list. This list includes members of the Solana community that earned their way into this list. No bots - no duplicates. This is the optimal community you want to have.

## What is the DAO going to be used for?

The DAO should be a platform where token holders submit proposals related to various community initiatives, create polls and initiate discussion. Members can then vote on these proposals to determine which ones receive the community’s support.
The DAO will be your community’s tool to allocate the crowdsourced funds.


## Is creating a market essential for your token?

### Reasons you might want to create a market upon launch for:

1. Launching a market can increase your token’s visibility.
2. The DAO has liquidity to bootstrap the pool coming from the options exercised. 

### Reasons you might not want to create a market upon launch for:

1. Creating a market requires resources.
2. Regulatory Concerns. (Depending on jurisdiction)
3. The team might want to strengthen the community or develop their product better before launching a market.
