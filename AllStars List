In our experience, token launches fail to find the best audiences due to the lack of a valid public repository of active wallet addresses to airdrop to & there is no mechanism for judging the qaulity of the airdrop lists themselves. 

From the vantage point of the community, not everyone wants to go hunting for airdrops & there is a large population out there who would rather skip the line then battle it out as reply guys on X. 

The Tatami List is the answer to these problems faced by projects & the community alike. Essentially, we aim to build an invite only, application based list of wallets to airdrop to. The wider community shall be able to subscribe to a place on this list in return for a monthly fee. In return, they will get an allocation in all qaulifying token launches through our platform. 

This is a win win for projects as well as they can be assured that the wallets on this list have gone through checks (as its application based inclusions) & are active (keeping up with their subscriptions).
